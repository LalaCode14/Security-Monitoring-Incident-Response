Internship Final Project
________________________________________
Internship Information

•	Internship Organization: Cryptonic Area

•	Internship Duration: 19 February – 28 February 2026

•	Project Name: Security Monitoring & Incident Response

•	Platform Used: TryHackMe – SOC Simulator (Introduction to Phishing)

•	Intern: Lala Alili

Project Overview

This repository contains the final project completed during the Internship Program at Cryptonic Area.
The project focuses on Security Monitoring and Incident Response, simulating real-world security monitoring activities in a controlled lab environment.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:

•	Monitor and analyze security alerts

•	Detect and investigate phishing attempts

•	Distinguish between false positives and true positives

•	Correlate alerts across multiple security data sources

•	Perform incident classification, escalation, and response

•	Propose future improvements aligned with security best practices

All scenarios are based on phishing simulations conducted using the TryHackMe SOC Simulator platform.
